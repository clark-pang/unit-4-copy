/* CHRIS NOTES LOL
potentially a linkedlist
a collection of nodes (segments)

their positions are based off 
of each other's previous position

this.head = the node from the head class
this.tail = null

this.topPosition = null;
this.leftPosition = null;

add segment method
- would need to fire everytime head class instance 
isInApple() === true

update position method
- needed for when the move() fires 
to move each segment forward

How to handle collision?
initial thoughts
- search method into a contains method
- contains method?
